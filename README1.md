# UI/UX Enhancement in FOSSEE Workshop Schedule Website

## Design Principles
It was created considering ease, readability, and usability. Iincreased font size so it would be easy to view from small screens. Button and link sizes were increased and separated so that it's easy to touch. I used contrasting colors for highlighting essential sections and ensured there was a smooth visual flow for user navigation.

## Responsiveness
I utilised Bootstrap's grid system and CSS media queries to ensure the site's composition adjusts automatically according to different screen sizes, particularly for mobile devices. The main menu was substituted with a collapsible hamburger menu in smaller displays in an effort to have a better user experience.

## Trade-offs
For speed, I avoided heavy images and animations that would slow down load time. While minimalist, the design facilitates better usability without over-optimising performance.

## Issues
The hardest was keeping it simple and easy to use on very small phones without overcrowding the screen. I did this by using a foldable menu and consistent padding for interactive elements.
